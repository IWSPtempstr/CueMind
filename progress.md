# Progress

## 2026-08-25

- Inspected current repository and existing evaluation contract.
- Read relevant Agent evaluation sections from the supplied assessment document.
- Added the detailed plan at `docs/plans/2026-08-25-cuemind-detailed-implementation-plan.md`.
- Added explicit Agent metrics, thresholds, trace schema, test matrix and release gates.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Confirmed no runtime code was modified; the new plan and internal planning notes are untracked documentation files.

## 2026-08-25 (Agent Reach and architecture decision)

- Read the upstream Agent Reach update/install instructions from the official repository.
- Installed Agent Reach `v1.5.0` in the user-level Python path and verified it from a fresh WSL login shell.
- Ran `agent-reach check-update`: latest version.
- Ran safe-mode install check and `agent-reach doctor`; no system-level changes were made.
- Confirmed the project plan supports three post-Ollama options; recommended `A` (local `llama.cpp` model retained), with `B` as a temporary remote fallback and `C` as an ASR-only slice.

## 2026-08-25 (P0 execution specification)

- Added the “执行规格与提交规则” section to the detailed implementation plan.
- Explicitly skipped `whisper-large-zh-cv11` download and comparison testing for this round.
- Fixed the current implementation order as P0 specification -> P1 complete local chain -> P2 replay evaluation -> P3 evidence-driven optimization.
- Defined per-phase task scope, allowed file boundaries, validation commands, and one submission requirement after each phase passes.
- Synchronized `task_plan.md` with the P0-P3 gates and recorded current unknowns.
- No runtime code was modified and no Git commit was created.
- The following remain unverified: local `whisper.cpp` execution and model quality, local Qwen3-4B structured output, real search behavior, Agent traces, end-to-end replay, latency, Windows audio capture, and remote fallback.

## 2026-08-25 (P1 local ASR contract)

- Updated `lib/local-asr.ts` to request whisper.cpp JSON/text artifacts, parse timestamped segments, calculate WAV duration and real-time factor, clean temporary output, and classify timeout/model/audio process failures.
- Updated `app/api/local-transcribe/route.ts` to return the expanded ASR result and validate an optional bounded timeout.
- Updated `hooks/useDesktopTranscript.ts` to serialize audio-chunk processing, suppress duplicate chunk IDs, and bound the pending queue to three items with explicit backpressure feedback.
- Added `scripts/test-local-asr.ts`, a fake-whisper regression check covering JSON segment parsing, text assembly, WAV duration, provider identity, and latency output.
- Verification passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `TMPDIR=/tmp npx tsx scripts/test-local-asr.ts`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check`.
- Real `whisper-cli`/model execution was not verified because no executable or model was found in the available WSL workspace. No `whisper-large-zh-cv11` artifact was downloaded.
